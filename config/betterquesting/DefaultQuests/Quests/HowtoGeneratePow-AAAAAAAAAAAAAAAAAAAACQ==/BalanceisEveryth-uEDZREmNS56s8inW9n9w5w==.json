The  Semi-Stable Antimatter Stabilization Sequencer introduces the concept of Semi-Stable Antimatter, created from Protomatter.\n\nBut it’s a cruel mistress... Fail to manage it, and antimatter could void itself into nothingness.\n\nThe Semi-Stable Antimatter is produced in cycles of 1 second, the amount generated is based on the total of antimatter current stocked in it\u0027s 16 Antimatter Hatches and consumes equal amounts of Proto Matter.\nThe change in Antimatter is equal to (§3Antimatter§r Total)^§6§n0.5§r * N(§b§n§c0.2§r, 0.25), being N a Gaussian Distribution, meaning the total antimatter change may be negative.\n\nThe Produced Antimatter is distributed between the 16 hatches also following the same Gaussian Distribution. This causes an imbalance between the hatches. To properly automate the antimatter production it\u0027s vital to always re-balance the amount of antimatter in the hatches, because at the end of each cycle the lowest amount of antimatter present in hatches is recorded and any hatch that contains more than the lowest amount, loses half the difference!\n\nProper use of stabilization fluids can significantly reduce energy usage and boost production:\n\nIt consumes 10,000,000 + (§3§oAntimatter§r * 1000)^§a§n1.5§r EU/t passively\nMagnetic Stabilization Fluids can mitigate the passive instability and have it\u0027s §a§oexponent§r reduced:\n- Molten Purified Tengam Exponent \u003d §o§n§a§n1.35§r\n- Tachyon-Rich Fluid Exponent \u003d §a§n1.§n2§r\n\nFor each cycle, the SSASS uses (§3§oAntimatter§r * 10000)^§d§5§n1.5§r EU\nBy regulating the gravity containment of the forge, this §5§oexponent§r can also be reduced:\n- Molten Spacetime Exponent \u003d §5§n1.45§r\n- Spatially Enlarged Fluid Exponent \u003d §5§n1.40§r\n- Molten Eternity Exponent \u003d §5§n1.35§r\n\nBy containing the antimatter more compactly, it is possible to generate bigger gains per cycle. Containment Stabilization fluids alter the §6§oexponent§r in the production formula:\n- Molten Shirabon Exponent \u003d §6§n0,55§r\n- Molthen MHDSCM Exponent \u003d §6§n0,60§r\n\nBy inserting fluids with high energy potential, it\u0027s possible to alter antimatter\u0027s flow in chaos, making their randomness more favorable. Activation Stabilization Fluids alter the §b§o§c§oskew§r of the gaussian distribution, lowering the risks of negative changes in antimatter and favoring better gains.\n- Depleted Naquadah Fuel Mk V skew \u003d §b§n§c§o§o§r§c§n0.25§r\n- Depleted Naquadah Fuel Mk VI skew \u003d §b§n§c§n0.30§r"
